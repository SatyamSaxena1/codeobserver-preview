# CodeObserver for Visual Studio Code

## Marketplace Summary
CodeObserver turns your editor into a strategic command center by blending GitHub Copilot completions with an always-on local AI observer. Ship faster with proactive insights, architectural guardrails, and release hygiene baked right into your workflow.

- **Category:** Productivity, AI-assisted development
- **Works with:** Visual Studio Code 1.84.0 or later (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **License:** Apache 2.0 (commercial-friendly)
- **Pricing:** Free. Enterprise support and roadmap partnerships available on request.

## Highlight Reel
1. **Strategic Insight Stream** ‚Äì Surfaces curated, high-signal insights about risky modules, drift from architectural goals, and TODO debt so you can act before regressions ship.
2. **Autonomous Workspace Analysis** ‚Äì Optional LM Studio integration lets the extension run fully offline against your local open-source models for secure environments.
3. **Release Automation Ready** ‚Äì GitHub Actions workflows, signed VSIX artifacts, and Marketplace-friendly packaging keep compliance teams happy.
4. **Instant Diagnostics** ‚Äì Verbose logging + Insight History make it trivial to reproduce how and why recommendations were made.

## Feature Deep Dive
- **Insight Dashboard:** Hoverable summary with quick actions to open related files or run a full workspace sweep.
- **Workspace Analyzer:** Invoke `CodeObserver: Run Strategic Analysis` to score your project against customizable objectives (architecture consistency, critical module drift, mission alignment).
- **Live Objectives:** Configure `codeObserver.objectives` to align the AI observer with your product OKRs.
- **LM Studio Bridge:** Point `codeObserver.lmStudio.*` settings at any local LM Studio deployment for air-gapped inference and pick the model via the `CodeObserver: Select LM Studio Model` command.
- **Verbose Telemetry:** Enable `codeObserver.verboseLogging` when you need to audit every decision.

## Installation
