# CodeObserver Preview 0.1.1

## What’s New
- **Manual activation command** — launch the observer only when you’re ready via `CodeObserver: Activate (Start Monitoring)`. The status bar now guides you to opt in, then switches back to quick insight access once monitoring is running.
- **LM Studio model picker** — use `CodeObserver: Select LM Studio Model` to browse installed models from the CLI or enter a custom identifier; the workspace setting updates automatically.
- **Lean activation flow** — monitoring hooks spin up lazily, so installing the extension no longer adds background listeners until you activate it.
- **Manifest compliance** — restored the required `activationEvents` entry so VS Code packaging succeeds while keeping monitoring opt-in.
- **Docs refresh** — README and integration guides now reflect the manual-activation workflow and the choose-your-own-model approach.

## Installation & Upgrade Notes
1. Update to version `0.1.1` from the Marketplace or download the VSIX attached to this release.
2. In a workspace, run `CodeObserver: Activate (Start Monitoring)` the first time you want insights—monitoring remains off until you do.
3. Configure LM Studio:
   - Set **CodeObserver › LM Studio › CLI Path**.
   - Run `CodeObserver: Select LM Studio Model` to pick a downloaded model or type an ID.
   - Enable **CodeObserver › LM Studio › Enabled** when you’re ready.
4. Save a file or run `CodeObserver: Run Strategic Analysis` to generate the first insight.

## Verification
- ✅ `npm test` (compiles TypeScript and runs the VS Code integration suite)

## Known Issues
- LM Studio must have the chosen model warmed; otherwise the extension falls back to deterministic insights.
- Copilot telemetry hooks remain placeholder when GitHub’s API is unavailable.
