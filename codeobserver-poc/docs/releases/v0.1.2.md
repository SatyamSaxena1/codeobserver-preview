# CodeObserver Preview 0.1.2

## What’s New
- **Persistent insight history** — strategic insights now survive VS Code restarts and reloads. The history panel automatically restores your last 50 entries when the extension activates.
- **One-click clean up & export** — new commands, `CodeObserver: Clear Insight History` and `CodeObserver: Export Insight History`, make it easy to tidy your archive or capture a sanitized JSON snapshot for sharing.
- **Interactive dashboard** — the new `CodeObserver: Open Insights Dashboard` webview gives you a filterable, searchable lens on recent insights with quick links back to the underlying files.
- **Telemetry snapshotting** — every export includes anonymized metadata (timestamp, analyzer, severity) so you can track trends without leaking sensitive content.
- **Tooling alignment** — TypeScript is now pinned at 5.5.4, keeping linting and build output consistent across environments.

## Installation & Upgrade Notes
1. Update to version `0.1.2` from the Marketplace or download the VSIX attached to this release.
2. Reload VS Code after installing so the persisted insight history restores correctly.
3. Use `CodeObserver: Open Insights Dashboard` to explore the new history view, or run the clear/export commands from the command palette anytime.
4. Optional: rerun `CodeObserver: Run Strategic Analysis` or save a file to populate fresh insights after clearing the list.

## Verification
- ✅ `npm run lint`
- ✅ `npm test`

## Known Issues
- LM Studio must have the chosen model warmed; otherwise the extension falls back to deterministic insights.
- Copilot telemetry hooks remain placeholder when GitHub’s API is unavailable.
