# CodeObserver - AI-Powered Development Companion

## üéØ **Core Concept**

A VS Code extension that runs a local AI observer (GPT-OSS-20B) in parallel with GitHub Copilot to provide strategic oversight, architectural guidance, and project alignment monitoring during development.

### **The Vision**
- **GitHub Copilot** ‚Üí Handles cutting-edge code generation (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Local GPT-OSS-20B** ‚Üí Acts as your "coding mentor" watching everything
- **VS Code Extension** ‚Üí Bridges the two, creating a dual-AI development environment

## üî• **Unique Value Proposition**

### **What Makes This Different**
- **Parallel AI Processing** - Doesn't interfere with Copilot workflow
- **Strategic Focus** - Architecture/design oversight vs tactical code generation
- **Full Context Awareness** - Understands your project holistically
- **Privacy-First** - All analysis happens locally using your LM Studio
- **Chain-of-Thought Transparency** - Shows reasoning behind suggestions
- **Non-Intrusive Design** - Ambient awareness without disrupting flow

### **Proof of Concept**
We've delivered an initial VS Code extension (`codeobserver-poc/`) that demonstrates the dual-AI workflow:

- Tracks file edits, saves, selections, and Copilot command executions (when the API is available).
- Generates deterministic "strategic insights" that mimic GPT-OSS-20B output.
- Surfaces insights through a status bar indicator, command palette actions, and history quick-picks.
- Ships with linting, testing, and documentation to accelerate iteration toward a production build.

Open the [extension README](codeobserver-poc/README.md) for setup instructions and explore the PoC locally with `npm install && npm run watch`.

### **How It Works**
```
Developer works normally with Copilot ‚Üí
Local AI observes all VS Code activity ‚Üí
Builds comprehensive project understanding ‚Üí
Provides strategic insights and warnings ‚Üí
Maintains alignment with original objectives ‚Üí
Prevents architectural drift
```

## üõ† **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Collection Layer**
```typescript
interface VSCodeActivity {
  copilotPrompts: CopilotInteraction[];     // What you ask Copilot
  copilotResponses: CopilotSuggestion[];   // What Copilot suggests
  acceptedSuggestions: AcceptedCode[];     // What you actually use
  fileChanges: FileChange[];              // All code modifications
  cursorMovements: CursorEvent[];          // Navigation patterns
  projectStructure: ProjectSnapshot;       // Current codebase state
  gitActivity: GitEvent[];                 // Commits, branches, etc.
  searchQueries: SearchEvent[];            // What you're looking for
  buildResults: BuildEvent[];              // Compilation/test results
}
```

### **Analysis Engine**
```typescript
const analyzeActivity = async (activity: VSCodeActivity) => {
  // Build comprehensive context
  const context = buildProjectContext(activity);
  
  // Create harmony format prompt for GPT-OSS-20B
  const prompt = createStrategicAnalysisPrompt(context, objectives);
  
  // Query with configurable reasoning effort
  const analysis = await queryGPTOSS20B(prompt, "medium");
  
  // Extract strategic insights
  return parseStrategicInsights(analysis);
};
```

### **Feedback System**
- **Ambient Awareness**: Status bar indicators showing project health
- **Strategic Alerts**: "You're diverging from the planned architecture"
- **Opportunity Notifications**: "Consider using a factory pattern here"
- **Progress Tracking**: "70% complete with user authentication module"
- **Code Quality Insights**: "Recent changes suggest refactoring opportunity"
